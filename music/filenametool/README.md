# music/filenametool
music related programs, utilites, etc. 
These are mostly about managing a library of recorded music.
So far, these are useful for music "ripped" and "tagged" from
commercial audio CDs. The utility works by reading the path and filename
of the songs and tried to parse and guess the artist, album and song name.
It can generate shell commands to rename the song files into a consistant
manner.
