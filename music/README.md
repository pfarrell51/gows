# music
music related programs, utilites, etc. 
These are mostly about managing a library of recorded music.
So far, these are useful for music "ripped" and "tagged" from
commercial audio CDs.

Perhaps in the future, I'll dabble again with MIDI and other music creation software.

1. dirwalker walk file directory and write out commands for ffmpeg and sox

2. filenametool walk file directory and write out commands based on file names

3.  randnames generate random two letter prefixes for file names
for cars that want to play in alphabetical order
 
4.  tagtool walk directories and analyze based on MP3 tags
 
5. verify Compare the file name against the metadata "tags" that are in the mp3 file.
List those that are sufficiently different.
