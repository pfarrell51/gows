# music/tagtool
music related programs, utilites, etc. for song files that contain "tags"
or metadata tags in the mp3/Vorbis/FLAC formats.
These are mostly about managing a library of recorded music.
So far, these are useful for music "ripped" and "tagged" from
commercial audio CDs.

This program assume that the files have been tagged by a utility such
as Musicbrainz's Picard (https://picard.musicbrainz.org/)
