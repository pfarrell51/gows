utility to provide two letter random prefix to songsnames
so that the Mazda's infotainment system will play them in a random
order. The Mazda's built-in random play shuffle algorithm leaves a lot
to be desired.

name prefix will be two alphabetic characters and the underscore "_"
character.

It can generate shell commands to rename the song files into a consistant
manner.
